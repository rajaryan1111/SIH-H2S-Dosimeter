# SIH 2026 — H₂S Dosimeter Wristband | AI-Based Quantitative Reading

> **Problem Statement**: SIH26118 — Passive Colorimetric H₂S Exposure-Dosimeter Wristband with AI-Based Quantitative Reading
> **Team**: Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (DSCE)
> **Category**: Hardware + Software (Hybrid)

---

## Project Overview

A low-cost, disposable wristband carrying a copper-acetate colorimetric strip that darkens progressively with
cumulative H₂S exposure. A phone photographs the strip next to a printed reference colour card; software applies
lighting correction and an ML regression to quantify the **cumulative dose in ppm·hr**.

Worker identity, shift data and exposure history are logged to a backend and surfaced on an admin dashboard for
occupational-health compliance reporting (DGMS / OISD).

### Engineering highlights

- **Computer vision:** ROI detection, RGB → CIE Lab conversion, CIE ΔE2000 and reference-card lighting correction.
- **ML:** Random Forest regression for cumulative H₂S dose estimation.
- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy with worker, reading, alert and reporting workflows.
- **Validation:** 49/49 API tests and 16/16 offline checks are documented in the repository.
- **Honest scope:** the current ML evaluation uses synthetic/physics-based data; real-hardware validation remains a project dependency.

The detection chemistry:

```
Cu(CH3COO)2  +  H2S  ->  CuS (grey-brown)  +  2 CH3COOH
copper acetate + H2S -> copper sulfide (dark) + acetic acid
```

Colour change is quantified with **CIE ΔE2000**, the international standard for perceptual colour difference,
implemented from the matrix formulas in:

> *"Deep learning-assisted colorimetric/electrical dual-sensing system for ultra-fast detection of hydrogen sulfide"*
> — ACS (se3c02793)

## Software Status

| # | Component | Directory | Status |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | ML pipeline (colour science + dose regression) | `software/ml_pipeline/` | Complete |
| 2 | Backend API (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + JWT + PDF) | `software/backend/` | Complete — 49/49 API tests, 16/16 offline checks |
| 3 | Admin dashboard (React + Vite + Chart.js) | `software/dashboard/` | Complete — login, dashboard, workers, submit reading, alerts, reports |
| 4 | Mobile app (Flutter + on-device TFLite) | — | **Not started** — directory does not exist yet |

All three built components are **independent processes** that talk over HTTP/JSON.

## Architecture

```
Worker wears wristband
      |  copper-acetate strip darkens with cumulative H2S exposure
      v
Colorimetric reading  (today: ml_pipeline/ on a workstation; Phase 4: on-device in the Flutter app)
      |- ROI detection (OpenCV / HSV)
      |- sRGB -> CIE XYZ -> CIE L*a*b*
      |- CIE DE2000 dE vs a fresh-strip baseline
      |- reference-card lighting correction
      |- ML regression  ->  dose_ppm_hr
      v
      |  POST /readings/   {worker_id, delta_E, dose_ppm_hr, Lab, RGB, temp, humidity, ...}
      v
Backend  (software/backend/ — FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)
      |- stores the reading
      |- evaluates DGMS thresholds and auto-creates alerts
      |- serves /dashboard/summary, /workers, /readings, /alerts, /reports
      v
      |  fetch() with a JWT bearer token   (VITE_API_BASE, default http://localhost:8000)
      v
Admin dashboard  (software/dashboard/ — React 19 + Chart.js)
```

**The backend does not run the ML model or OpenCV.** It receives an already-computed `dose_ppm_hr` and only
stores, aggregates and alerts. Keep the two decoupled — do not add `scikit-learn` or `opencv` to the backend.

---

## Running the System

Three terminals. The backend and dashboard are needed for a full demo; the ML pipeline is standalone.

### 1. Backend — `software/backend/`

```bash
cd software/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed.py                 # optional: WIPES the DB and loads demo workers/readings/alerts
uvicorn main:app --reload      # -> http://localhost:8000   (Swagger UI at /docs)
```

Demo credentials are seeded by `seed.py` for local development only; do not reuse them in production.
before any real deployment.

### 2. Dashboard — `software/dashboard/`

```bash
cd software/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev                    # -> http://localhost:5173
npm run build                  # production bundle into dist/
npm run lint                   # oxlint
```

Reads the backend URL from `VITE_API_BASE` (default `http://localhost:8000`). See `.env.example`.

### 3. ML pipeline — `software/ml_pipeline/`

```bash
cd software/ml_pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt

python image_processor.py      # colour-math self-test, no data required
python demo_simulator.py       # synthetic dataset -> train -> save model + calibration plot
python model_evaluator.py      # diagnostic plots (needs a trained model + dataset)
python live_ai_demonstrator.py # narrated walkthrough; POSTs to the backend if one is running

# with real labelled strip photos:

[![CI](https://github.com/rajaryan1111/SIH-H2S-Dosimeter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/rajaryan1111/SIH-H2S-Dosimeter/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
python dataset_builder.py --images_dir ./sample_images --output datasets/dataset.csv
python model_trainer.py --csv datasets/dataset.csv
```

`demo_simulator.py` must be run at least once before `model_evaluator.py`, since `models/` and `datasets/` ship
empty. `sample_images/` is also empty — no real strip photographs have been collected yet.

`env_compensation.py` requires a large IoT sensor archive that is **not** in the repository (git-ignored, local
only); it will report a missing-file error without it.

## API Surface

Every endpoint below is implemented in `software/backend/routes/`.

**Public** — no token required:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/` | Service banner + docs links |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness + database probe |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Exchange username/password for a JWT (form-encoded) |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Swagger UI |

**Authenticated** — require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; a missing or invalid token returns **401**:

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | Current officer identity + role |
| `GET` | `/workers/` | List workers; filter by `site`, `shift`, `active_only` |
| `GET` | `/workers/{worker_id}` | Single worker by code, e.g. `WRK001` |
| `POST` | `/workers/` | **admin only** (→403 otherwise) |
| `PUT` | `/workers/{worker_id}` | **admin only** |
| `DELETE` | `/workers/{worker_id}` | **admin only** — soft-delete (sets `is_active=false`) |
| `POST` | `/readings/` | Submit a scan; evaluates thresholds and may create an alert |
| `GET` | `/readings/today` | All readings for today's shift date |
| `GET` | `/readings/worker/{worker_id}` | Per-worker history; optional `shift_date`, `limit` |
| `GET` | `/readings/{reading_id}` | Single reading |
| `GET` | `/alerts/` | All alerts; filter by `unacknowledged_only`, `alert_type` |
| `GET` | `/alerts/worker/{worker_id}` | Per-worker alerts |
| `POST` | `/alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge` | Sign off an alert |
| `GET` | `/alerts/summary/counts` | Counts by type and acknowledgement state |
| `GET` | `/dashboard/summary` | Aggregated worker statuses + headline counts |
| `GET` | `/reports/worker/{worker_id}/json` | Report data for charts |
| `GET` | `/reports/worker/{worker_id}/pdf` | DGMS-format PDF (ReportLab) |

Safety officers and admins are the only login accounts. **Workers are data subjects, not user accounts**, so
there is no per-worker login and no per-worker IDOR surface.

---

## DGMS Compliance Thresholds

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| TWA (8-hour average) | 10 ppm |
| STEL (15-minute) | 15 ppm |
| Cumulative dose — **warning** | 60 ppm·hr |
| Cumulative dose — **danger** (8-hr TWA reached) | 80 ppm·hr |
| Cumulative dose — **critical** (evacuate) | 100 ppm·hr |

The backend owns these thresholds and is the single source of truth for alert generation. They are currently
**duplicated** as module constants in `routes/readings.py`, `routes/dashboard.py` and `seed.py` — change all
three together.

---

## Configuration

No secrets are committed. Copy the templates and edit locally; `.env` files are git-ignored.

### Backend — `software/backend/.env.example`

| Variable | Default (dev) | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | Set to `production` to enforce the checks below |
| `SECRET_KEY` | insecure dev fallback | **Required in production** — the app refuses to start without it |
| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | `HS256` | |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `480` | 8-hour shift |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./h2s_dosimeter.db` | PostgreSQL-ready, e.g. `postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/db` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173` | Comma-separated. **Not** `*` — set it to the deployed dashboard origin |

Generate a production secret with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
```

### Dashboard — `software/dashboard/.env.example`

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `VITE_API_BASE` | `http://localhost:8000` | Only `VITE_`-prefixed vars reach the browser bundle — never put a secret here |

Also note: schema changes are applied by SQLAlchemy `create_all()` at startup. There is no migration tool, so an
existing SQLite file will not pick up new columns — delete it or re-run `seed.py` after a model change.

---

## Testing

### Backend

```bash
cd software/backend
python test_offline_checks.py    # 16 checks, no server and no jose/bcrypt/reportlab needed
```

```bash
# terminal 1
uvicorn main:app --reload
# terminal 2
python test_api.py               # 49 integration tests; re-seeds the DB first
```

`test_api.py` covers health, login, 401/403 enforcement across every protected route, worker CRUD, reading
submission with alert generation, alert acknowledgement, the dashboard summary and both report formats
(including an authenticated PDF download).

`test_offline_checks.py` verifies the dashboard aggregation refactor against the previous per-worker query loop
and confirms alert serialization, using an in-memory SQLite database.

### ML pipeline

```bash
cd software/ml_pipeline
python image_processor.py        # asserts RGB->Lab against 5 known colours and dE(x,x)==0
python demo_simulator.py         # end-to-end; warns if test R2 falls below the 0.85 target
```

### Dashboard

```bash
cd software/dashboard
npm run build                    # must succeed
npm run lint                     # 0 errors (6 pre-existing warnings in Dashboard/Workers/Alerts/Reports)
```

There is **no automated frontend test suite.** The Submit Reading flow was verified manually against a live
backend in headless Chrome — login, roster load, all four presets, alert generation, the Alerts/Reports/Dashboard
knock-on effects, client-side validation and a backend 404 path. That was a one-off harness and is not committed;
re-verification is manual.

### Last recorded results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `test_api.py` | 49/49 passed |
| `test_offline_checks.py` | 16/16 passed |
| `npm run build` | succeeds |
| `npm run lint` | 0 errors, 6 pre-existing warnings |
| Submit Reading browser walkthrough | 69/69 assertions passed (manual) |

## ML Model Performance

From `demo_simulator.py` on **synthetic** data — a physics-based colour model, not real strip photographs:

| Metric | Representative run |
|--------|--------------------|
| Test R² | 0.8630 (target: > 0.85) |
| RMSE | 11.37 ppm·hr |
| MAE | 8.89 ppm·hr |
| Selected model | RandomForest (CV R² 0.9152) |
| ΔE metric | CIE DE2000 |

**These numbers are not reproducible run-to-run.** `simulate_strip_color()` draws noise from an unseeded
generator and the dose array is shuffled with an unseeded global shuffle, so each run produces a different
dataset. Observed spread across recent runs was roughly **R² 0.89–0.93**, and the winning model alternates
between RandomForest and PolyRidge_deg2. Treat the table as one representative run, not a fixed benchmark, and
quote your own run when reporting.

Accuracy on real hardware is still unknown — no strip photographs have been collected. The
`BASELINE_LAB` and `REFERENCE_PATCHES_LAB` constants in `image_processor.py` are calibration values; changing
them is a recalibration, not a refactor.

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Image processing | Python, OpenCV, NumPy |
| Colour science | CIE L\*a\*b\*, CIE DE2000 |
| ML | scikit-learn (RandomForest / GBM / SVR / Ridge), joblib |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic v2, python-jose, bcrypt, ReportLab |
| Database | SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL-ready (prod) |
| Dashboard | React 19, Vite 8, Chart.js, react-chartjs-2, oxlint |
| Mobile (planned) | Flutter, TFLite |

---

## Not Yet Implemented

Verified against the repository as of this commit:

- **Mobile app** — the largest remaining piece. `software/mobile_app/` does not exist; only `.gitignore` entries
  anticipate it. The intended path is Flutter with on-device TFLite inference, reusing the `model_trainer.predict()`
  contract and posting to `POST /readings/`.
- **Real strip-photo dataset** — `sample_images/` is empty; all results to date are synthetic.
- **Environmental compensation wired into prediction** — `env_compensation.py` trains a standalone model but
  nothing consumes its output in the dose path yet, and its input archive is not in the repository.
- **Production deployment** — no Dockerfile, no CI/CD, no hosting configuration. A real `SECRET_KEY`,
  `CORS_ORIGINS` and a PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` must be supplied.
- **Database migrations** — schema is created by `create_all()`; there is no Alembic setup.
- **Automated frontend tests** — no test runner is configured for the dashboard.
- **Worker edit / deactivate UI** — the API supports both (admin only); the dashboard only lists and creates.
- **Login rate limiting** — `POST /auth/login` is unthrottled.
